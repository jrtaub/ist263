        <h1>Jamie Taub's Biography</h1>
        
        <p>My name is Jamie Taub, I am currently a sophmore at Syracuse University studying <strong>Policy Studies and Society, Innovation, and Technology with a concentration in Project Management and a minor in History</strong> The combination of these two majors will allow me to prosue a career as a consultant, managing projects and operations for companies. To add on, my history minor reflects my passion for understanding the past and learning from its mistakes to create a better future. Moreover, some of my proudest accomplishments are making Deanâ€™s list for the past three semesters, being a Teaching Assistant as a sophomore, holding a 3.7 GPA, earning the Founders Scholarship, and being an Invest Success Scholar. Outside of school, I love to spend time with my two sisters, my mom and dad, I enjoy spending time with friends, going on hikes, watching Hamilton, tutoring history, and giving campus tours as a University 100 tour guide.</p>
            <h2>Personal Information</h2>
            <p>Furthermore, a defining part of my journey is living with dyslexia, a learning disability that has shaped my perspective on life. Overcoming the challenges associated with dyslexia has taught me the importance of self-advocacy and advocating for others. My learning disability has demonstrated to me the importance of using my voice to advocate for those who may feel unheard and has guided my academic and career choices. </p>
