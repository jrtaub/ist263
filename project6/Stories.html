<p>“Growing up with dyslexia has been both a challenge and a defining part of my 
    journey. In first grade I struggled with reading, spelling, and math, often feeling lost and resorting to 
    "faking it" just to keep up. To figure out what was wrong, my parents had me tested where I was 
    diagnosed with dyslexia. Imagine telling a six year-old they have dyslexia; imagine telling a six year-old 
    who barely knows what's going on they have a learning disability that will affect them forever. In order 
    to set me up for success, my parents sent me to the Windward School. Windward is a school that 
    focuses on teaching children with dyslexia strategies to help them learn in the classroom. The Windward 
    School became a turning point, providing me with strategies, confidence, and self-advocacy skills that 
    transformed the way I learned. Returning to public school in eighth grade came with new challenges, as 
    different teaching styles and misconceptions about dyslexia made me feel like I had to prove myself all 
    over again. Through hard work, I advanced into AP classes and showed that my learning disability did 
    not define my abilities. My experience has driven me to educate others about dyslexia, advocating for 
    those who feel unheard, and the passion to pursue a future in public service where I can fight for equal 
    opportunities for all."

    <p>“Growing up I always felt like there was something wrong with me. I always 
        wondered why all my peers were reading Harry Potter and Mystery Tree House while I was still 
        impressed with my ability to read The Giving Tree. When most of the other kids were allowed to pick 
        from the more advanced selection of books in class I was one of few that was only allowed to pick from 
        the lowest reading ability section. I would always do so poorly on my spelling tests despite constant 
        practice and help from my mom at home. For years I was put into reading groups with kids who were 
        properly diagnosed with severe dyslexia and I was the outside kid who was just a bad reader while all 
        the other kids went to recess. I always just thought I would one day become an excellent reader and 
        speller and catch up to my friends but that still hasn’t happened at age 20. It took until I was 14 to be 
        tested and diagnosed for Dyslexia and since then I have been able to be properly treated with academic 
        support. I was able to seek help from teachers and reading specialist to help me find tools to work with 
        my dyslexia. Today I feel less anxious and stress when having to read in front of people because I know 
        that I am not just dumb but I am at a disadvantage but I also have the tools and resources to feel 
        confident with my dyslexia.”

    <p>“ My parents knew from an early age that I struggled in school. My mother was 
        told by my 1st grade teacher that “not all kids go to college”. At that time, I was considered an average 
        student in school, I got Cs and Bs but there was always a discrepancy, I could remember material easily 
        when reading was not required. In 4th grade, my parents brought me to Hofstra University where they offered a study skills class. There 
        was a placement test, which I failed both times I took it. My parents were told, that has never happened 
        before. I took the class, but it did not make a difference. It is always surprising to me that my parents 
        never took the next steps to try to figure out what was limiting me in school. I was just considered a bad 
        test taker. In 8th grade, my teacher was very puzzled on how I could answer questions in class and remembered all 
        the material that she taught in class but would fail the tests. She took the time with me and allowed me 
        to take her tests after school and I aced every one of them. My parents still did not look into why I was 
        facing challenges academically. At that time, it was ok to be an average C/B student. I never took accelerated classes and did not do 
        well on the SAT, but I always had a great attitude. In 11th grade, I finally figured out my own strategies 
        and started to do much better in school. I attended Syracuse University and graduated with a Policy 
        Studies major and a dual minor in Sociology and Child/Family Studies. I then attended Columbia 
        University and graduated with my MSW.”
