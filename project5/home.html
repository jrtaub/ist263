    <h1>What is dyslexia?</h1>
    <p>As defined by the Mayo Clinic, dyslexia is a learning disability that causes difficulty in 
        reading due to complications in speech sounds and setbacks in the relationship between letters and 
        words. There are five main branches of dyslexia: Phonological, Rapid Naming, Double Deficit, Surface, 
        Visual.</p><br>

        <h2>5 main types of dyslexia</h2>
        <p>Phonological Dyslexia- is characterized by the struggle with recognizing and manipulating sounds of 
            words. Additionally, individuals face issues with phonemic awareness which causes effects in reading 
            and writing, and spelling.</p><br>
            <p>Rapid Naming Dyslexia- is characterized by difficulty with the ability to rapidly identify number, letters, 
                or colors. Additionally, this form of dyslexia will affect individuals reading speed and how fast they can 
                process words and sentences while reading. </p><br>

                <p>Double Deficit Dyslexia- this form of dyslexia is a combination of phonological and rapid naming dyslexia.
                    Since individuals will struggle with identifying sounds and naming speed, double deficit is known as the 
                    most sever branch.</p><br>

                    <p>Surface Dyslexia- is characterized by being able to sound out new words but the failure to identify 
                        familiar words automatically. It is understood that this form of dyslexia is caused by failure of the brain
                        to quickly identify and process a word. Additionally, surface level dyslexia makes it hard to memorize 
                        words that sound different than they appear.</p><br>

                        <p>Visual Dyslexia- is characterized by the inability to remember words, sentences, patterners, colors, or 
                            shapes. Additionally, the connection between the eyes and brain are not working together, therefore 
                            the brain does not get the same or full picture that the eyes see impairing an individuals ability to learn 
                            how to spell and form letters.</p><br>

                            <h3>What are two common misconceptions about dyslexia? </h3>
                            <p>One of the most misconceptions about dyslexia is the relationship between dyslexia and intelligence. 
                                Many people believe that individuals with dyslexia are unintelligent and academically inferior. How this 
                                is not true there is absolutely no connection between dyslexia and intelligence, many individuals with
                                dyslexia are extremely bright and creative they just learn differently the most students do. For example, 
                                Bill Gates is one of the most creative and smart men in the world, despite his learning disability he was 
                                able to create Microsoft which is now a worth $3.065 Trillion.</p><br>
                                <p>Another major misconception about dyslexia is that an individual can grow out of it. In reality, dyslexia 
                                    is a lifelong disability, but with the right teaching methods, practice, and reinforcement, individuals can 
                                    learn to manage its effects. Specialized schools and programs provide structured learning strategies that 
                                    help dyslexic students build skills in reading, writing, and comprehension. Once these strategies become 
                                    ingrained through consistent practice, individuals can apply them naturally, sometimes giving the false 
                                    impression that they have been "cured." However, dyslexia has no cure, only effective strategies and 
                                    techniques that empower individuals to succeed despite the challenges they face.</p>
