            <p>As defined by the Mayo Clinic, dyslexia is a learning disability that causes difficulty in reading due to complications in speech sounds and setbacks in the relationship between letters and words. There are five main branches of dyslexia: Phonological, Rapid Naming, Double Deficit, Surface, and Visual.</p>

                <h2>5 Main Types of Dyslexia</h2>
                <div class="dyslexia-types" >
                    <div class="dyslexia-type" tabindex="0">
                        <h3> Phonological Dyslexia</h3>
                        <p>is characterized by the struggle with recognizing and manipulating sounds of words. Additionally, individuals face issues with phonemic awareness which causes effects in reading and writing, and spelling.</p>
                         </div>
                    <div class="dyslexia-type" tabindex="0">
                        <h3> Rapid Naming Dyslexia</h3>
                        <p>is characterized by difficulty with the ability to rapidly identify number, letters, or colors. Additionally, this form of dyslexia will affect individuals reading speed and how fast they can process words and sentences while reading.
                        </p>
                    </div>
            
                    <div class="dyslexia-type" tabindex="0">
                        <h3>Double Deficit Dyslexia</h3>
                        <p>this form of dyslexia is a combination of phonological and rapid naming dyslexia. Since individuals will struggle with identifying sounds and naming speed, double deficit is known as the most severe branch.</p>
                    </div>
            
                    <div class="dyslexia-type" tabindex="0">
                        <h3>Surface Dyslexia</h3>
                        <p>is characterized by being able to sound out new words but the failure to identify familiar words automatically. It is understood that this form of dyslexia is caused by failure of the brain to quickly identify and process a word. Additionally, surface level dyslexia makes it hard to memorize words that sound different than they appear.</p>

                        <h3> Visual Dyslexia</h3>
                        <p>is characterized by the inability to remember words, sentences, patterners, colors, or shapes. Additionally, the connection between the eyes and brain are not working together, therefore the brain does not get the same or full picture that the eyes see impairing an individuals ability to learn how to spell and form letters.</p>

                <h2>What Are Two Common Misconceptions About Dyslexia?</h2>
            
                <div class="misconceptions" tabindex="0">
                    <img src="../images/misinformation.png" alt="Misconceptions Image">

                        <p>One of the most common misconceptions about dyslexia is the relationship between dyslexia and intelligence. Many believe that individuals with dyslexia are unintelligent, but this is untrue. Dyslexia does not affect intelligence, and many individuals with dyslexia are extremely bright and creative. For example, Bill Gates is one of the smartest and most creative men in the world, despite his learning disability. He created Microsoft, which is now worth $3.065 trillion.</p>
                        <p>Another misconception is that an individual can grow out of dyslexia. In reality, dyslexia is a lifelong condition, but with the right teaching methods, practice, and reinforcement, individuals can manage its effects. Specialized programs provide structured learning strategies that help dyslexic students improve their reading, writing, and comprehension skills.</p>
